# Uncertainty quantification in machine learning using conformal inference
This repo provides code examples for an introduction to uncertainty quantification (UQ) in supervised machine learning with an emphasis on conformal inference. Also a code example for UQ in (parametric) bayesian statistics is provided. 

# Setup

Create virtual environment with required packages 
```bash
python3 -m venv env_uq
source env_uq/bin/activate
```

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
